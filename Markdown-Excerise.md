## Examples of **Bold** and *Italic*
This is **Bold** and This is *Italic*
### Examples of Lists
#### Reasons why I think Batman is overrated and isn't better than Superman:
- Batman is strictly a plot armour character that realistically should have no chance against the other characters of DC
- DC gives characters like Superman and Martian Manhunter dumb weaknesses such as kryptonite and fire just to give him a chance
- The only excuse Batman fans can give on why he wins is *prep time*, where he can set up gadgets, but even with that, Superman and the Flash can easily beat him with strength and speed
#### Characters I think could and should beat Batman every time including Marvel characters:
1. Superman
2. Martian Manhunter
3. Flash
4. Wonder Woman
5. Green Lantern
6. Thor
7. Hulk
8. Spiderman
9. Captain America
10. Black Panther
11. Iron Man
